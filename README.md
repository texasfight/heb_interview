# HEB Coding Assignment

## Details

This repo contains my code and configuration files for spinning up a RESTful API for uploading images and performing object detection on them.

## Running

To run this example, please install Docker on your machine and run:

```shell
docker compose up --build -d
```

And three containers should come up to serve the app, with port 8080 on localhost serving the API.


## API Docs

Once the API is running, the live Swagger docs can be found at (http://localhost:8080/docs)[http://localhost:8080/docs].
